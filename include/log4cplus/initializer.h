   This class helps with initialization and shutdown of log4cplus. Its
   constructor calls `log4cplus::initialize()` and its destructor calls
   `log4cplus::Logger::shutdown()`. Use this class as the first thing in your
   `main()`. It will ensure shutdown of log4cplus at the end of
   `main()`. This is particularly important on Windows, where shutdown of
   standard threads outside `main()` is impossible.
